    answer:     ''''	There are two main causes: Natural and Human induced wildfires.
Naturally caused wildfires: They are wildfires induced by natural phenomena with no human intervention, depending on different circumstances , for example:
1.	Lightening ( Lightning is the most common ignition source that causes the vast majority of wildfires. )
2.	Coal-seam fires (burning of an outcrop or underground coal seam )
3.	 Volcano
4.	Meteor
Human caused wildfires: They are wildfires induced by human intervention, because of:
A.	Mistake.
B.	Premeditation.
C.	Negligence.

*For example:
1.	Campfire (Cooking, warming, bonfire).
2.	Smoking (Cigarette, cigars, pipes, and matches/lighters used for lighting tobacco).
3.	Fire Use (Debris burning, burning ditches, fields or slash piles, etc.
4.	Incendiary (Arson, illegal or unauthorized burning
5.	Equipment (Vehicles, aircraft, exhaust, flat tires, dragging chains, brakes, etc
6.	Railroads (Exhaust, brakes, railroad work, etc.
7.	Juveniles (Fire play - matches, fireworks, lighters, etc.

8.	Miscellaneous (Includes burning buildings, fireworks, power lines, shooting (ammo, exploding targets), spontaneous combustion (hay baled while still wet, compost piles, oily rags), blasting, and coal seams.

    question: 'What are the STEPS of a wildfire\'s development?',

    answer:     '''' Incipient – This first stage begins when heat, oxygen and a fuel source combine and have a chemical reaction resulting in fire, which in general is known as an ignition . Recognizing a fire in this stage provides your best chance at suppression or escape.

Growth – The growth stage is where the structures fire load and oxygen are used as fuel for the fire. There are numerous factors affecting the growth stage including where the fire started, what combustibles are near it, ceiling height and the potential for “thermal layering”. 
Fully Developed – When the growth stage has reached its max and all combustible materials have been ignited, a fire is considered fully developed.  This is the hottest phase of a fire and the most dangerous for anybody trapped within. (the most danger).

Decay – Usually the longest stage of a fire, the decay stage is characterized a significant decrease in oxygen or fuel, putting an end to the fire.  Two common dangers during this stage are first – the existence of non-flaming combustibles, which can potentially start a new fire if not fully extinguished.  Second, there is the danger of a backdraft when oxygen is reintroduced to a volatile, confined space.

    question:  'What are the Consequences of a Wildfire?',

    answer:     '''' 1.	Polluted Water Resources:
As Watersheds may retain higher levels of nitrogen and dissolved carbon dioxide for 15 years after a wildfire, reducing drinking water quality within surrounding communities. In 0, elevated nitrogen and phosphorus from burned vegetation result in harmful algae blooms. Eating shellfish contaminated with toxic algae could result in paralysis or even death, while other people may experience severe vomiting, seizures, or diarrhea.
2.	Vegetation:
* Unfortunately, the loss of vegetation can significantly alter an ecosystem by increasing erosion, reducing nutrient availability in the soil, and posing a heightened risk for disease and pest infestations. In turn, these may prolong regrowth or impact what grows in the area affected by the fire. Additionally, vegetation that once served as a habitat may threaten wildlife survivability.
* Forest vegetation can absorb 7.6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, making it vital to protect one of the world’s largest carbon sinks from further destruction.


3.	Endangered Wild:

The impacts of wildfires on foraging animals such as grazers and large insects are particularly significant, especially as new celebrities drive key ecosystem functions such as biota and pollination.

4.	Air Quality:
* Particles from smoke and the burning of hazardous chemicals can also travel long distances, further reducing air quality and bearing multiple respiratory and cardiovascular ailments for humans and wildlife.

    answer:     '''' •	Avoid lighting fires in dry, hot, and windy weather conditions.
•	Construct campfires in open areas away from vegetation and extinguish them thoroughly.
•	Avoid driving over dry, grassy areas as vehicle exhaust may spark a flame.
•	Ensure vehicles and outdoor equipment are working correctly.
•	Find alternatives to gender reveal or other celebratory devices that create sparks.
•	Don’t light fireworks in dry and unsafe outdoor conditions.
•	Keep water nearby if you plan to burn leaves and debris on your property.

    answer:    '''' Amazon Forest Fire (2019)
One of the most destructive and recent forest fires, a record rate of 73,000 fires has been detected at the Amazon rainforest this year by Brazil’s space research center, INPE. The rainforest, which contributes almost 20 percent of the earth’s oxygen, has burned for more than half a month, which created a major loss of biodiversity.
Although forest fires are common in the Amazon during this time of the year due to extremely dry weather, there was an 83 percent rise in the fire compared to the 2018 fire. According to environmentalists, 99 percent of the forest fires have been caused by human actions, either deliberate or accidental. The Brazilian city has plunged into sudden darkness with a dark, smoky haze that has enveloped the city. Even the rain that poured down smelled like smoke.
